Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quick Check: Same version?

The documentation assumes you are using Release 0.2.0-alpha.3
with a 'shred' of abn-739.  The shred changes frequently, and
is a quick reference to the current version of the program,
independent of other means to reference this.

The signon message when the program is running does not reflect
the current release version and is (instead) one version behind.

This is a cosmetic difference, only.

If you glance at the 'abn' number/version when the program
starts printing information to your terminal, you'll generally
be up to speed in identifying which version is currently loaded
onto the target board (give or take several commits, as the abn
number is only updated a few times each development session).

It generally changes at least once per calendar date of development.

See 'Versioning' (below) for a bit more on referencing which
version is documented here.



Super Quick Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Download the program
 * Unpack it as usual
 * Find it in Arduino IDE
 * Select the .ino file as usual
 * Compile for your target
   Reference target: Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4
 * Upload to your target
 * Connect to your target in the Serial Monitor
 * type 'words' or 'wlist' (wlist is less encompassing but less cryptic)

 * if pressing ENTER does not give desired result, try pressing Control J instead.



Really Quick Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Unpack the .ZIP or tarball where you want it
 * Install/update required libraries from inside the Arduino IDE
 * Compile in the Arduino IDE
 * Upload the compiled file to the target
   (ItsyBitsyM4 is the reference target)
 * Connect to the target (via the USB connector on the target)
   in the Serial Monitor

   See: Cortex-Forth/doc/program_init.log  for sample output

 * type 'words' or 'wlist' and press ENTER or Control J



Communications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reference implementation uses communications via the
'microcom' program.  Serial Monitor seems to work acceptably
well, for quick testing (this has been verified).

Usual invocation is:

 mc $ microcom -p /dev/ttyACM0

A lot of information is produced by the running program, and
printed to your terminal, when the program starts.

xterm is assumed; most text-based communications/shell windows
can be expected to function, though this is unproven and untested.

Most serial communications programs should produce at least
a minimally useful environment.  Examples of such programs
are screen, seyon, minicom, and gtkterm.

Only minicom and microcom are used to test, and usually only
microcom is used.

The Serial Monitor should work, but it isn't supported, as it
uses a line-by line input, rather than character by character
as you type.

Serial communications are established from inside
flash_setup() found in ./src/flash_ops.cpp:

 $ cat -n src/flash_ops.cpp | egrep 38400
   110    Serial.begin(38400);
 $

Screen is another option to talk to the target board.

Screen may be invoked with:

 $ screen  /dev/ttyACM0 38400

Control A, followed by a backslash, should prompt to exit 'screen'.

Almost Really Quick Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Change directory to

 Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3/Cortex-Forth

 Do a directory listing to locate yourself.

 Mainfile is named 'Cortex-Forth.ino' and is only
 included once.  When a simple directory listing reports
 Cortex-Forth.ino is present, you are in the intended,
 top level directory for program development.

 Additional active files are found in the ./src tree,
 including flash_ops.cpp and forth_words.cpp and others.

 YOU NEED ADDITIONAL LIBRARIES.

 SdFat_-_Adafruit_Fork
 Adafruit_SPIFlash

 Also used (ItsyBitsyM4 in particular uses this):

 Adafruit_DotStar

 To operate the onboard dotstar RGB LED.

 The Arduino IDE was used to install all three of these
 libraries, for the reference implementation.  All are
 current published versions.

 dog.cpp is a junk file meant to collect relevant comments
 at the very top of that file (to help differentiate between
 tiny similar revisons to the program).  It may be ignored,
 for practical work on the program.



Quick Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 $ zcat ../Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

You should be in a unique directory before executing the
previous command, with the necessary file written to the
directory one level up from where 'cd' has placed you. ;)

The output of 'tar' there might look something like this:

Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3/
Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3/.gitignore
Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3/Cortex-Forth/
Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3/Cortex-Forth/.gitignore
Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3/Cortex-Forth/0_archived.d/
Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3/Cortex-Forth/0_archived.d/.gitignore
Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3/Cortex-Forth/0_archived.d/_dumpram.cpp_deprecated_

 ... with many lines following the snippet just given.

 $ pwd
/somewhere/temp.d # yours will be whatever you named 'temp.d' to be)
 $ ls
Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3
 $ cd Cortex-Forth-0.2.0-alpha.3/Cortex-Forth/
 $

    This release is interim.  Has further factoring of the Forth sources.
    
    Support for \ comments is now available.  Better support
    for ubiquitous line endings (use 0x0d 0x0a to end all
    source code lines).

      TEF MEK Hn-t

Although it says 'alpha.2' it is already 'alpha.3' there.
The abn-739 numbering is accurate.

'TEF MEK Hn-t' generally tracks with the abn number (if one
is incremented, so is the other).

The above is the exact signon message as the program version
that is documented here.
